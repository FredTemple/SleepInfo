# Sleeping tips when staying indoors during isolation period

_This information is written for people who have to self-isolate and stay indoors for an extended period of time. If you are sleep deprived because of lack of opportunity to sleep (e.g., frontline health professionals, support workers, carers), please prioritize sleep and rest as much as you are able to._

## Part 1: Support our body clock and daily rhythms
Sleep is controlled by biological, social, and environmental time-keepers. These include the amount of light we are exposed to, time-of-the-day when we eat our meals, exercise, interact with others, and many more. When we stay indoors for a long period of time, we lose many of these cues. This can be challenging for a good night’s sleep and regular daily routines. 
- **Get up around the same time every day**. Your get-up time is like an anchor to your day and night. Keeping a consistent get-up time will help other parts of your day fall into a regular routine. Also, our sleepiness increases as we spend longer time awake during the day. Getting up around the same time helps us accumulate similar amount of sleepiness around our usual bedtime, and therefore help us more consistently fall asleep round the same time at night.
- **Get bright light into your eyes first thing in the morning upon getting up and seek light during the day**. Our body clock (or circadian pacemaker) in the brain is tuned by light. A powerful time-keeper is morning bright light into the eyes at around the same time every day. Bright light has the added benefit of promoting alertness, especially if you find mornings being a slow start. Try opening curtains and let in direct sunlight, or turn on bright lights if you don’t have access to natural light.
- **Eat meals around the same time each day, especially breakfast**. Like light, eating also serves as a time-keeper and helps to make our body rhythms regular. Eating at the same time of day not only helps our rhythms biologically, but it also helps maintain our daily routine, which is important for both sleep and mental health.
- **Make your first social interaction of the day at the same time each day**. Like eating, this helps to keep our daily routine regular. Regularity helps our sleep, and the consistent interactions help our mood. When you are in isolation, interacting with others can be difficult. If you live with someone, be sure to interact with them first thing in the morning. If you live alone, schedule a call with friends or family at the same time each morning. Even a quick “hello” and check-in is useful. The other person will probably appreciate the human contact, too!
 - **Exercise around the same time each day, avoid being sedentary for long stretches of time**. Exercise indoors can be challenging. Many video streaming sites have nice at-home workouts you can follow.

- **Keep daytime and night-time different and separate**. Our body clock likes keeping day and night clearly distinguished. During daytime, keep living space full of light, and do more active things around the house, such as cooking, cleaning, indoor exercises. In the evening, keep lights dim, and do quieter activities such as watching TV, reading. 
- **Avoid bright light 1-2 hours before bedtime**. Keep lights dim 1-2 hours before your usual bedtime can help your body naturally produce melatonin, which helps prepare your body for sleep.

## Part 2: Prevent and tackle signs of insomnia
Having some nights when you don’t sleep well during this stressful period is expected. Occasional poor nights’ sleep is not to be overly concerned. If you do have nights like that, things below can help prevent turning one night’s poor sleep turning into many nights of insomnia.
- **Bed is for sleep and sex only**. It’s tempting to move laptop, phone, TV, and even meals into the bedroom and onto the bed. But doing this, could trick our brain into thinking that bed is a place for waking activities, and not sleep. Over time, our brain learns to be more awake, and not sleepy in bed. Keeping bed and bedroom for sleep and sex is a super-helpful thing to do when you spend extended period of time indoors. If you have limited space, and have to use bed or bedroom, you could allocate one side of the bed for sleep only, and go to other parts of the bed or bedroom when you are awake. Only do this if you truly have no other options for daytime activities.
- **Picking the right time to go to bed is the key to falling asleep quickly**. The best time to go to bed is when it’s **around your usual bedtime (not too early, not too late)**, and that you are **feeling that “wave” of sleepiness is arriving**. For some people this may feel like alertness is lower, eyelids are heavy, thoughts are slowing down. Learn to “surf the waves” of sleepiness, and “catch” it as your bedtime is a very helpful way to fall asleep quickly. 
- **Do not attempt to sleep when you are alert, fully awake, or distressed**. Going to bed during these times can only make falling asleep harder and more frustrating. Even if it is your usual bedtime, if you are feeling very alert, upset, or distressed, do not try to fall asleep. Instead, do something quiet and relaxing to help your brain and body “calm down” before trying to fall asleep.
- **If you cannot get to sleep and become wide awake, agitated, or frustrated, get up, and take a break from trying**. Most of us have been through nights like that – we toss and turn, our mind racing, and feeling increasingly frustrated that sleep just doesn’t come. Ring a bell? Your past experience probably tells you that keep trying harder doesn’t make sleep come any faster. This is the time to actually take a break from trying, have a “reset”, and come back later. Try getting out of bed, doing something quiet, such as listening to audiobook, reading, folding laundry, colouring… Gradually, you would notice that your alertness goes down again, and the “wave” comes, and as this happens, go back to bed. 
- **Worrying about sleep makes it harder to sleep**. We are often our own worst enemy when it comes to sleep. After a poor night sleep, it’s quite understandable to think “how am I going to sleep well tonight?”, “how can I cope with not sleeping well?”, “my poor sleep last night must be affecting my health”. Guess what, these thoughts actually make us feel more anxious around sleep and bedtime. Feeling anxious and tense is exactly the opposite of sleep, which is all about calm and rest. What about “I can’t force myself to sleep. Let me focus on relaxing each part of my body, and rest. Sleep will come at its own time.”
- **Basic sleep hygiene goes a long way**. Avoid caffeine at least 6 hours before bedtime; cigarettes are alerting, so avoid it in the evening; reduce alcohol – you may feel drowsy after drinking it, but it disturbs your sleep second half of the night, not at all helpful for sleep. 
- **What to do after a poor night’s sleep?”**
	- **Don’t stay in bed for longer to “make up” for sleep loss**. Our body makes up for sleep loss by sleeping **deeper, not necessarily longer**. When we are sleep deprived, our brain automatically recharges by having more deep sleep, which you may not notice. Staying in bed for long period of time is likely to give you more “broken” sleep, and not necessarily more restorative sleep. 
	- **Sticking to usual get-up time after a poor night sleep**. Sleeping in after a poor night’s sleep could counter-productively delay our body clock. This means that we may not be as sleepy around our usual bedtime, which could make it even harder to get to sleep. 
	- **Go to bed around or after usual bedtime**. This means **not going to bed too early to make up for sleep**. The few hours before our usual sleep time are known as the “wake maintenance zone” – meaning we are particularly alert. If we go to bed much earlier, it could make getting to sleep even harder. 
	- **Avoid naps during the day**. If you have plenty of opportunity to sleep, but sleep poorly at night, skipping naps during the day can help nighttime sleep.
